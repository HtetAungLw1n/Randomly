To continue using Gemini, download the new Gemini app from the App Store.”\nThis change occurred because Google wants to prioritize the Google Gemini app for iOS instead of needing to maintain Gemini features in multiple apps. Since the company released a proper Gemini app late last year, it’s only natural that the company is focusing on it.","image":"https://bgr.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/google-gemini-app-iphone-extensions.jpg?resize=1020%2C574&quality=82","date":"2025-02-20"},{"title":"‘Scream’ alum Matthew Lillard hints that killer Stu Macher is coming back","image":"https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/gettyimages-2170608884.jpg?c=16x9&q=h_653,w_1160,c_fill/f_webp","date":"2022-10-01","description":"This line, famously spoken by the character Stu Macher in the original 1996 “Scream” movie, made a momentous new appearance Thursday when actor Matthew Lillard, who played Stu, posted a video on Instagram Thursday teasing a return to the “Scream” franchise after 30 years away.In the video, a disembodied hand is seen writing the phrase – one of the final lines spoken by Stu in the movie after he was was revealed to be the accomplice to killer Billy Loomis (Skeet Ulrich).","id":"2a42fcc4-ea21-4bdd-abf6-c40006dc66a9"},{"title":"Christopher Nolan’s next film will be a star-studded adaptation of Homer’s ‘The Odyssey’","image":"https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/2024-03-10t000000z-1932757668-hp1ek3a1ugh2d-rtrmadp-3-awards-oscars.JPG?c=16x9&q=h_653,w_1160,c_fill/f_webp","date":"2022-10-01","description":"Universal Pictures announced this week that Nolan will be directing a cinematic adaptation of “The Odyssey,” an ancient poem believed to be written by Homer between 750 and 650 BCE centering on the character Odysseus’ 10-year trek home after the Trojan War.Nolan’s forthcoming adaptation is described as “a mythic action epic shot across the world using brand new IMAX film technology,” according to the studio’s announcement posted to their X page Monday.","id":"2a42fcc4-ea21-4bdd-abf6-c40006dc66ac9fds"},{"title":"‘The Substance’: What to know about Demi Moore’s powerhouse new film","image":"https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/thesubstance-still-06-c2b7c275-58dd-4b55-8475-8145e00901fd-copy.jpg?c=16x9&q=h_653,w_1160,c_fill/f_webp","date":"2022-10-01","description":"Unless you’re already into genre films, it might be easy to dismiss “The Substance,” at first glance, as a too-gory entry in the body horror category.But upon deeper inspection, this sophomore effort from French writer-director Coralie Fargeat (whose first feature, 2017’s “Revenge,” was adored by critics) is a firmly self-aware and feminist fable that warns – quite graphically – of the pitfalls of blindly chasing youth.","id":"2a42fcc4-ea21-4bdd-abf6-c40006dc66a9fsds"}],"users":[{"email":"hurricane@gmail.com","password":"$2a$12$KrX/W8rk2uJ4xMzaSpgUXuewXyXpnveVeWc9vT79YyHWI6eO7/JlS","id":"24dacf03-9117-4089-b028-d2f3b2d6e7b9"}]}
