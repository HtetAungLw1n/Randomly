About 100 corporate workers will move from Louisville to Plano in the next six months as a result, according to the company. \n\nThe parent company wants to bring additional teams together with the idea of better serving its customers, franchisees, workers and shareholders, Yum CEO David Gibbs stated. \n\nYum and the KFC Foundation will maintain offices in Louisville, and Taco Bell and Habit Burger & Grill, also Yum-operated, will stay headquartered in Irvine, California. Another roughly 90 remote workers will be asked to relocate to Plano and Irvine during the next year and a half, the company said.\n\nA number of corporations, including those in the tech industry, have recently relocated to Texas. Elon Musk's rocket company SpaceX transferred its incorporation from Delaware to Texas last year and Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg in January stated the company's content oversight teams would be moving from California to Texas.

To continue using Gemini, download the new Gemini app from the App Store.”\nThis change occurred because Google wants to prioritize the Google Gemini app for iOS instead of needing to maintain Gemini features in multiple apps.
